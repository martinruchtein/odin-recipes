    <p>The muffuletta, the classic New Orleans sandwich, is surprisingly easy to make at home. This muffuletta recipe — complete with flavorful cold cuts, sliced cheese, and homemade olive spread — is authentically delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (1 pound) loaves Italian bread</li>
        <li>8 ounces thinly sliced Genoa salami</li>
        <li>8 ounces thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
        <li>8 ounces sliced mortadella</li>
        <li>8 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces sliced provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the olive salad: Roughly chop together green olives, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, cauliflower, cocktail onions, garlic, capers, celery, and carrot.</li>
        <li>Combine with oregano, basil, black pepper, and celery seed in a medium bowl. Add in olive oil, canola oil, and vinegar. Mix together and transfer the mixture into a glass jar (or other nonreactive container). Pour in more oil to cover if needed.</li>
        <li>Cover jar or container and refrigerate at least 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>To make the sandwiches: Cut loaves of bread in half horizontally; hollow out some of the excess bread to make room for filling.</li>
        <li>Spread each piece of bread with equal amounts of the olive salad, including oil.</li>
        <li>Layer bottom half of each loaf with 1/2 of the salami, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, and Provolone slices.</li>
        <li>Replace top half on each loaf and cut the sandwiches into quarters.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, or wrap tightly and refrigerate for a few hours; this will allow for the flavors to mingle and the olive salad to soak into the bread.</li>
    </ol>
